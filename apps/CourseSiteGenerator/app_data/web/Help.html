        <p>The Course Site Generator will be a traditional workspace-type application that will let the user create a
            new course site and export a full generated site as needed. The first important thing to understand is
            what may go into a course site. Not all courses use the same content, or even the same pages for their
            sites, but some things, like the navigation bar structure, will be uniform. The following course site
            provides an example of what a course site might look like. Note that it has all four pages (Home,
            Syllabus, Schedule, HWs) that our application will be able to generate.
